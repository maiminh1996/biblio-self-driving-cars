> **_Metrics:_**  AP 3D, AP 2D, AP BEV, AOS

### 3D object detection
>**_[visua-map](https://github.com/Cartucho/mAP)_**

| Metric | Description | Unit |
| -- | -- | :--: |
| AP 3D | overlap in 3D (AP) | |
| AP 2D | overlap on image (AP 2D) | |
| AP BEV | overlap on ground-plane (AP Bird eye view)| |
| AOS | oriented overlap on image (Average Orientation Similarity AOS) | |

### 2D object detection

| Metric | Description | Unit |
| :-- | -- | :--: |
| AP 2D | overlap on image (AP 2D) | |
