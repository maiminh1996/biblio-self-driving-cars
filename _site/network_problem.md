## Network design

| Net prob | Ref | Des | Formula |
| -- | -- | -- | -- |

### General notes
- Need to leverage these encoders like ResNet, DenseNet, etc which are pre-trained on ImageNet dataset
- decoder part uses Bilinear Upsampling (brief: a ‘smoother’ image overall after upsampling) rather than simple Upsampling
