<p>Others: <strong>Ultrasonic</strong> systems emit ultrasonic sound waves and determine distance by how long these waves take to return to the source (this is how bats echolocate). Ultrasonic sensors are good for close-range detection in all weather, but do not have the range of LIDAR or radar.</p>

    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Level 3</td>
      <td>This level includes basically fully autonomous features, but will warn a driver when the driver needs to take control. This is incredibly complicated to do, because once humans get used to the self-driving function, we tend to doze off or get distracted. This level won’t deliver an appreciable jump in safety over level 2, so many companies are skipping this step</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Level 4</td>
      <td>Nearly autonomous. It may be possible for a human to control the car, but the car will drive itself completely and shut itself off if things go wrong.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Level 5</td>
      <td>Completely autonomous; these cars lack pedals or a steering wheel and are not meant to be driven by humans.</td>

  </tbody>
</table>

<p><strong>Semi-autonomous</strong> features are essentially in levels 1 through 3, and, like Tesla’s Autopilot feature, are already in some luxury cars now.</p>

<p><strong>Fully autonomous</strong> cars, at levels 4 and 5, do not require a driver to be present at all. This type of vehicle is very far off, and some question its viability, but wide adoption of fully autonomous vehicles would be the true revolution some are anticipating.</p>
